			<p>As earth's largest land animal, the elephant stands out for being able to pick up objects with its trunk. Pachyderma is the name for the thick skin they share with rhinoceros and hippos. Elephants are matriarchal. They live in groups led by the biggest and oldest female. Being herbivores, elephants live off grasses, leaves, shrubs and fruit.</p>
